Here are some random specifics that I need to come back to at some point.

- COM_DELAY/COMMON_DELAY Register (0x1f80'1020)
- RAM cache in different segments
- variable RAM size (what if reg 0x1f80'1060 is changed!)
- Mirrored RAM?
    - 2MB of ram can be mirrored to the first 8MB (enabled by default)
- expansion regions
- BIOS ROM can be mirrored to the last 4MB (disabled by default)
- Cache Control -- enable scratch pad 1 and 2 together
