Here are some random specifics that I need to come back to at some point.

** Debug **
- change mem r/w breakpoints to watchpoints
- don't auto delete breakpoints and watchpoints
- organize debug modules sensibly

** Emulation **
- COM_DELAY/COMMON_DELAY Register (0x1f80'1020)
- Ram options can be configured (using RAM SIZE register)
- expansion regions
    - expansion 1 should return 0xff if not available
- BIOS ROM can be mirrored to the last 4MB (disabled by default)
- Cache Control -- enable scratch pad 1 and 2 together
- Move from coprocessor should use the load delay slot
- Interrupts register
